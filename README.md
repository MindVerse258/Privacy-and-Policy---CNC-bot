# Privacy-and-Policy---CNC-bot
This bot was made by ItzMind (You can call me Not_ItzMind or Salmon) and some random guys on the website on the Internet 
(They don't give me their name).
# READ IT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU!

This is the Privacy and Policy or the Changing Name Color bot, which works on Discord.

Your Privacy is important to me and the team who created this bot. This text explains what information we collect, how we use it and
how we store them. If you do not agree anything below, please stop using this bot.

## WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT:

As mentioned before, this is simply just a Discord bot, so we just need to collect the information that is mandatory for this bot to work.
Including:
Your server's name,
Your server's role system,
Your roles

For your server's name, we use them to manage servers which are using our bot. Which is easier when there are too many servers
using our bot and we need to fix bugs of the bot.

Your server's role system and your roles: it's obviously the MOST IMPORTANT thing that we need to make this bot works. If not,
we didn't make this. The Discord username's color is based on which color does your role have, and we use your roles to change color.

### HOW WE USE THOSE INFORMATION?

To be honest, we DON'T AND NEVER use those information, the BOT uses them.
We barely don't have any purpose on what to use them for.

#### HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION?

We don't store them. There are two reasons:

First, computer issue. To be honest, my computer, which I used to make this bot is a low-end laptop. It has 4 disks and a total of
500 GB or memory. If there are many people, I can't store all the data.

Second, your information when you send to us is being deleted immediately. Yeah, low computer's memory.

# FINALLY:
We don't share any information to the third-party.
